## Passion For Fatherhood

You know, in the world of tweets, you ever wondered what would your life tweet would be?
Like, one tweet that encompasses all your life. A Life Tweet. Yeah, a one liner that would sum up your entire life.
I'd love to read me some life tweets man.

You know, a fun place to visit once in a while is a cemetery. Depending on what kind of person you are, strolling along those graves could be fun. I'm the kinda person who walks in a cemetery reading the gravestones. That's fun. That brings life into perspective. To me the line engraved on a gravestones is that ultimate life tweet.

I mean think about it, you're dead and your family gets together and they say "well we gotta get him a gravestone and the tradition I guess is to, well, write stuff on it, I guess."

And they have this family meeting, brainstorming ideas for your gravestone.

"Well it should say his name."

"Yeah that's a good idea. Definitely put his name up there."

"Also the year he was born and the year he died."

"Oh yeah definitely, good ideas everyone."

"Is that it? Anything else?"

And that young nephew in the corner goes "well everyone kinda has a one liner there too on their gravestone."

"You're right", everyone else pitches in, "we wouldn't want grandpa to feel left out without a one liner on this gravestone."

"Alright this is gonna be a long night. Let's order some pizza."

So what would your family put on your gravestone? What would be your ultimate one liner, your ultimate one tweet that would sum up your life.

Honestly, I can't think of a more important question that each and every one of us needs to answer. I mean, not everyone, at least us mere mortals. The immortal superheroes among us can take a coffee break while the rest of us think about this a bit.

So, assuming you're a mortal, and that one day you'll be living your last day. Think about it. The last breakfast, the last time you wake up. The last time you walk through a cemetery. Because as of next week you'll be living there permanently. And the reason why this question is so crucial is because we have no idea when that day will come. It could be this day. This could be the last article you read.

Crazy ominous. But tell me I'm lying. No, I'm not lying. It's true. We have no idea.

Now, you might choose to delay that thought about your own mortality and we actually do that all the time. As I'm writing this I'm enjoying a beautiful day out sitting on a bench next to my wife who is also writing a blog post of her own. Super romantic, just writing. No, but seriously, what if this the last time I see my wife? And the last time I see my kids? What if this is it?

Nah, I choose to ignore it, sip my coffee and enjoy the day like it's gonna last forever. We always do that.

But, sooner or later, we will all live that last day. And how will people remember us?

When they're in that family meeting, eating pizza at 1am and struggling to come up with that one liner for your gravestone, what would they come up with? It would be interesting to see that brainstorming process. To see all the one liner they came up with but weren't quite right.

Now, check it out. If you had to write your life tweet, what would you write? What would it say on your gravestone if you had to choose what it would actually say?

This is so important because this is the springsource of our ultimate life mission. When we're lost, when we're confused, when we're angry, when we lose, when we win, always, always, we always go back to our life mission and we refocus our hearts and our minds on that and we keep going. That's the ultimate key to living a meaningful life.

We can't live meaningful lives though, unless we have meaningful purposes to live for. And to discover that purpose, I think the best exercise I can think of is what would your life one tweet be? What would you want people to remember you by, in one sentence? The least words the better.

We come up with that, and then we just live the rest of the days we have left, striving towards that, even if we never truly attain it. It's not about attaining it. It's about know what direction to aim. It's about know where to spend our focus, our energy, our time. Our precious time.

Here's my life tweet. Here's how I'd like to be remembered. If you walk by my grave one day, I mean you know, after I die, this is what I'd like for it to say, after my family's all night pizza think-a-thon. This is what I'd love for them to say after consulting with one another and with all the people that have ever known me. If that were even possible.

This is it folks. Here goes.

> Here lies Dan, the best Dad.

That's it. That's how I want to be remembered. If I win at Fatherhood, I think I will win it all. If I fail that, I don't consider any other victory worth celebrating. Now, "the best"? Yeah like that's even possible. But think about it. Out of all the fathers in the world, there's gotta be a Top 100 at least right? And out of that a Top 10. And 9 out of those Top 10 would probably concede and say "guys, who are we kidding, this guy's number one." Now, what wouldn't I give to personally know every single one of those Top 100 out there and even personally have the pleasure of meeting Mr. "Best Dad" alive today. But it's hard. And I probably know I would not even make it to the top 1 million. But like I said, that's not the point. The point is not reaching perfection because it's unrealistic. There's only 1 nr. one in every sport, in every competition. But what matters is that everyone is striving for that. Even if you reach number 1 for like a split second, in your niche, that's the ultimate win.

Well, for me, my niche is Fatherhood. I most probably will not even make it to top one billion before I die but I know what I'm striving for. I know why I'm alive. I know why I exist.

And if the people I love will one day think I'm number one, even for a split second, even after I'm long gone, enough to consider writing that on my gravestone, I'll be happiest man. Dead or alive.
