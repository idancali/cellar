## Complaining On Social Media

You see all these people on social media complaining.

But within that market of complainers there's a niche. The niche of the social media complainers that are complaining on social media about social media. And within that niche, the ultimate species of complainers are the ones using a particular social media platform to vent their frustration about that platform.

Like take LinkedIn for example. I see people writing open letters to the CEO of LinkedIn. On LinkedIn. So while they're updating their profile - on LinkedIn, you know, to get a job, they remember. So they open up their post editor and start typing. Dear Jeff, LinkedIn sucks, it's not what it used to be. Then they pause while talking to a potential employer - that you know, might give them a job - using the LinkedIn - FREE - instant messenger right at their fingertips. And as soon as they finish their complaint and they press 'enter', they continue browsing the feed - liking, commenting and sharing useful tips and information to their network - you know, in case someone might notice and maybe give them a job.

I mean imagine, doing the same thing in any other line of business.

You walk into a restaurant and start eating and while you eat, you start yelling around.

"Hey, this food is terrible, I wanna talk to your manager. Would you pass me the salt, John? Yeah good talking to you too,  you know, in a restaurant, over a meal. How's the family? Hey is that manager coming or what? How's the kids?"

"Sir, I hear you've asked to see me."

"Oh yeah", as you wipe your mouth with the pristine linen napkin, "I mean there's just not enough humph in this food you know. Also the whole mood of the place is ... ahhhh I dunno. You know what I mean?"

"No sir, in fact I have no idea what you mean."

"Ah, never mind. You can go back to your kitchen. I need to finish this meal. Hey, I hope my table is reserved for tomorrow night as well right? I have another business meeting here tomorrow night, same time, same table. Every night. So John, do you have any job openings?"
