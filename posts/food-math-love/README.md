## Food Math & Love

Love and math don't match man.

I calculate the food in my plate.

When I met my wife she used to take food from my plate and mess with my calculations. I was young and in love and my food math was flawless.

Now, after 15 years, I still calculate but I factor in a much higher margin of error. My food math is crap now. I just eat what's on my plate and I could care less if I carry the 1 from the mashed potatoes or not.

Love is all that matters now baby.

Unless you love math too much, then you'll just die all alone, eating perfectly balanced food portions for the rest of your miserable single life.
