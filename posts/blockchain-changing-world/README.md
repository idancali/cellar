## How Blockchain Is Changing The World

It's tough being a tech entrepreneur today, man.

Being an entrepreneur is just not what it used to be.

I remember the good old days when being a real tech entrepreneur meant being completely broke and building something hideous that only you and your two best nerd friends would get excited about.

But those days are long gone because we now live in a brand new era. The blockchain era. And being a real tech blockchain entrepreneur is a whole new ball game.

Yup, blockchain is here to stay and it will change the world in ways we have yet to imagine.

For instance, blockchain is changing the world of romance. Oh yeah, big time.

Gone are the old ways when a romantic date meant having a moonlight dinner under a beautiful star-filled sky with the woman you love.

But no, blockchain changed all of that.

No man, these days, when a blockchain guy takes his girl out on a romantic moonlight dinner, towards the end of the date, when he just puts his arm around her like a real gentlemen and she rests her head on his shoulder, they both gaze up at the stars and the moon - all that's going through his head is "when moon?"

Yeah blockchain is changing everything man. The world's just not the same it used to be.

I remember coming home and my wife would ask me how the day went and I'd be like "still didn't make any real money today honey, but we're making real progress." Being a real entrepreneur used to be pretty straight forward, you're out there trying to solve a real need while not making any real money. Pretty straight forward.

Blockchain changed all of that now. Big time.

Now, being a blockchain entrepreneur is completely different.

Now when I don't even know what to say when I come home.

"Daddy, how was work?"

What does a blockchain entrepreneur say to his wife and kids these days man?

"So everybody, sit down. First, daddy needs to explain how bitcoin works. But before that, we need to go over the double spending problem. And before that let's go through some elementary math."

That's too much.

Nah, I just end up saying "remember when daddy was trying to solve real needs while not making any real money?"

"Uh huh"

"Right, so now I'm not solving any real needs and I'm not making any real money and even if I were to make some it's not really real, it's crypto."

Blockchain's changing everything man, I tell ya.
