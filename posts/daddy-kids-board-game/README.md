## Daddy & Kids Board Game Night

I love my kids to death. They're my life.

And I love playing board games with them.

Gives my wife a break too and gives me a chance to just bond with my kids. Just daddy and the kids time. So usually we play a board games and just have a good time.

But there's those times when I get home and I just had one of those terrible days.

In my head I'm fighting these stupid code bugs man and when you're a programmer and you're fighting a bug for like three days straight and you just can't beat that bug you're just going crazy out of your mind. Like the whole world just stops spinning and until that bug is defeated you won't sleep you won't eat you won't take sugar in your coffee. Nothing.

But, I get home and it's daddy and the kids game night.

So oh yeah yayyy let's play, what's today, monopoly night? Yeah, yay let's do it.

So my youngest son usually loses at monopoly and he immediately start complaining saying "no not monopoly, I hate monopoly, daddy always wins".

And I'm thinking "yeah, except against that stupid bug. Can't beat that thing."

"Oh no", I say, "it's gonna be fun don't worry".

And my oldest daughter, the real brains of the entire outfit, outsmarting the rest of us put together, goes, "don't worry, you know daddy always lets us win if we have no money left. If you're outta money and you land on his properties he'll give you a discount, don't worry."

And the more time passes, in my mind I feel even more defeated by that bug. So I'm grossly impatient at this point. I'm so conflicted because that bug got me so worked up but it's not my kids' fault so I just nod my head and roll the dice.

And the kids are happy, everyone's happy, yayyy the dice have been rolled, game night is officially on.

But in my head there's like a storm and I'm completely obsessed with being defeated by that bug and I'm thinking, "enough defeats. I'm not losing tonight. Tis board is mind. I'm taking you all to school today. I own this board. No one's getting any discounts tonight."
