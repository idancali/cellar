### Guys Stepping On A Lego

Guys here's an interesting question I ask all my guy friends and a question for all guys out there really.

Are you a boy or a man?

That's it. Simple question. You don't have to answer it, but now you heard so it's good luck not thinking about it.

Most young guys have a problem answering this question.

"I mean I dunno, I mean, sometimes I guess I feel like a man and sometimes more like a boy. Ya know?"

"Yes Scott, I know. I know."

But here's the problem.

We don't really have a good boy-to-man test anymore.

I mean back in the days - and I mean the good old gather-n-hunt tribal days - the tribal chief would hand you a handmade stone knife when you're like - ahhh 10? - and say, "boy, you go out there into the woods tonight and you don't come back here until you bring back the head of a dangerous animal. Capiche?"

You'd go out there holding that knife and being afraid of the dark and you might come back or not. They didn't have statisticians back then so we have no idea how many boys came back as men holding out the head of a dangerous animal. No idea. But, at least the had a test.

Today, a 20 year-old guy, sits on his fluffy couch on his smartphone scrolling and doing real hard dangerous work. Sharing memes. The closest he gets to the head of a dangerous animal is sharing memes of animals sticking their out of water or something.

Like that meme of that shark sticking its head of the ocean with his mouth open. And the caption reads "rare photo of a shark stepping on a lego."

Scotts shares it with his friends and comments "yeah man, haha, I hate when that happens."

Wait. What? What do you mean, Scott? How would you know what stepping on a lego even feels like?

I'm a dad and my boys play with lego all the time. I kid you not when I say I step on lego blocks at least a couple of times a week. Average that over 12 years of parenting, that's like 300 arghhh shark-outta-the-water pain-like moments.

I mean that was probably painful the first couple of hundred of times. After that I just keep on walking you know. Now I step on a lego like a boss. The lego block is probably scared out of its mind when it smells my feet coming close. "Oh no, it's the dad, it's the dad, he's vicious, he just keeps on going, he doesn't cry like the other ones."

Yeah brah, a dad steps on a lego like a real man.

Now, if you're a 20-year old boy sitting on a couch all day long - you know "killing time" - because no one needs time anyways, might as well kill it - how would you even know what stepping on a lego means? You have no kids leaving lego blocks all over the floor, there might be empty pizza boxes you need to step over or into, but no lego blocks.

So when you share the meme and you're saying "I hate when that happens" are you lying? Because if you're lying, and you have no idea what stepping on a lego feels like, then there's your manhood test right there, son. You don't know what stepping on a lego block feels like? You're not a man yet. Still a boy.

But maybe Scott's not lying, maybe he does know what stepping on a lego feels like. But since he has no kids those lego blocks must of his own lego blocks. So the only way Scott would know would be if he steps on own his own lego.

But then, our manhood test still stands strong.

Being a man is stepping on a kid's lego block and you keep on going like a boss. Being a boy is not knowing the pain of stepping on a lego or crying like a baby when stepping on your own lego.
