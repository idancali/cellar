## Question

> Why do people ask "what should I do with this food?"

### Comments

* I mean, what else is there to do with food other than eat it, give it away or throw it out.
* Giving stuff away and throwing stuff out applies to everything so technically it doesn't count as actions worthy of considering.
* So what else can you do with food other than eat it?
* I mean if you get creative, maybe you could do other stuff with it after all.
* Maybe wear it?
* You could technically crochet spaghetti into a scarf. Sure.
