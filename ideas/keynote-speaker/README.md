## Question

> Why do people use "keynote speaker" as a role?

### Comments

* It means nothing. It's describing an action, the action of delivering a keynote presentation. Not a role.
* What if we were to turn other actions into roles?
* And is being a keynote speaker so much more important than a speaker that it's worth adding the "keynote" in there?
* What's wrong with being just a speaker?
